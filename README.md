- 👋 Hi, I’m @jscordino, AKA Jonathan Scordino. I work for the Makah Tribe as a Marine Mammal Biologist.
- 👀 I’m interested in marine mammals and marine biology questions in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and working on prey consumption estimates for sea lions in northern Washington.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that relate to marine biology in northwest Washington, particularly for marine mammals.
- 📫 I can be reached at jonathan.scordino@makah.com
